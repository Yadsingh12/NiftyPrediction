# NiftyPrediction
This repository consists of my efforts in trying to use data science and machine learning to be able to predict whether the price of nifty stock go up or down at the closing time.
Aim: my aim is to predict whether the market will go up or down
At the start, I thought of using relevant data of a day to predict whether close price of nifty on next day will be less or grater than closing price of nifty at that day. This approach had a validation accuracy of 46 percent lesser even lesser than a random guess
